Running with pure C:

gcc -fPIC -o main main.c numericalInt.c -I. -lm

./main <numInterations>


Running with swig (Hybrid - C with Python)

./run.sh <numInterations>

It will compile and then run the python program with time. 
Must verify if the path of python includes is correct inside the script run.sh.


Running with pure python


python numericalIntPurePython.py <numInterations>
